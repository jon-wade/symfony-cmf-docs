SonataAdminIntegrationBundle
============================

    The SonataAdminIntegrationBundle provides admin services for the Sonata
    Admin tool. Additionally, it provides admin extensions to improve your
    custom admins.

Installation
------------

should we move tutorial sonata-admin.rst here and get rid of the tutorial?

Usage
-----

The integration bundle provides admins for the CMF bundles. Configuration
sections are enabled dynamically, based on whether each bundle is installed or
not.
